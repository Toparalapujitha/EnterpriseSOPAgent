# EnterpriseSOPAgent
"EnterpriseSOPAgent: An AI-powered knowledge management system leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers to employee queries, citing exact sources from Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)."
An AI Agent that can answer employee question by reading the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures PDF files of the organization), citing the exact source and preventing all hallucinations.
In this project we are pivoting from the conventional MERN stack to an AI-MERN hybrid architecture stack, which is fit for today's AI era.
We have incorporated LLM support JS modules 'LangChain.js/LlamaIndex.TS' for logical processing, Vector Databases 'MongoDB Atlas' for sematic understanding, and a dedicated LLM orchestration to manage complex, 
multi-step queries. Its a sophisticated 'Agentic System', that integrates adavnced LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash/Groq - Llama 3) to the Node backend. 
We have used technologies like Reactjs and SSE (server sent events) for creating a streaming user interface frontend.
